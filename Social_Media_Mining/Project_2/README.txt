naive_bayes.java – contains the code for the Naïve Bayes Classifier 

k_nearest_neighbor.java – contains the code for K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier

combined_classifier.java – contains the code for Combined Classifier of naïve bayes and k-nearest neighbor.


To run each of the classifiers:


Inside folder Classifier,


1)     javac naïve_bayes.java

       java naïve_bayes
     

2)     javac k_nearest_neighbor.java

       java k_nearest_neighbor


3)     javac combined_classifier.java

       java combined_classifier

      
Inside folder Data,

Place training.txt and testing.txt inside Data folder

training.txt contains the training data for the classifiers.

testing.txt contains the testing data for which hashtag prediction needs to be done.
